The first order of business is to create a new Azure notebook. Azure notebooks are contained in *libraries* whose primary purpose is to group related notebooks. In this exercise, you will create a new library and then create a notebook inside it.

1. Navigate to https://notebooks.azure.com in your browser and sign in using your Microsoft account. Then click **Libraries**.

1. Click **+ New Library**. Then create a new library named "Keras." You may uncheck the "Public library" box if you'd like, but making the library public allows the notebooks in it to be shared with others through links, social media, or e-mail. If you're unsure which to choose, you can easily change a notebook to public or private later on.

1. Click the **+** sign to add a notebook to the library.

1. Name the notebook "Keras Lab.ipynb" and select **Python 3.5 Notebook** as the item type. This will create a notebook with a Python 3.5 kernel. One of the strengths of Jupyter notebooks is that you can use different languages by choosing different kernels.

	If you're curious, the .ipynb file-name extension stands for "IPython notebook." Jupyter notebooks were originally known as IPython (Interactive Python) notebooks, and they only supported Python as a programming language. The name Jupyter is a combination of Julia, Python, and R â€” the core programming languages that Jupyter supports.

1. Click the new notebook. This will launch the notebook and allow you to start editing it.

You can create additional libraries and notebooks as you work with Azure Notebooks. You can create notebooks from scratch, or you can upload existing notebooks. In the next exercise, you will use the notebook you created to build a neural network from scratch.
