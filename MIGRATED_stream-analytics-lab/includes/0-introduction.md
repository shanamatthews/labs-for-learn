You are the leader of a group of climate scientists who are concerned about the dwindling polar-bear population in the Arctic. As such, your team has placed hundreds of motion-activated cameras at strategic locations throughout the region. Rather than manually examine each photograph to determine whether it contains a polar bear, you have been challenged to devise an automated system that processes data from these cameras in real time and displays an alert on a map when a polar bear is photographed. You need a solution that incorporates real-time stream processing to analyze raw data for potential sightings, and one that incorporates artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to determine with a high degree of accuracy whether a photo contains a polar bear. And you need it fast, because climate change won't wait.

In this lab, you will build such a system using [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) and [Microsoft Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/). Specifically, you will use an [Azure IoT hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/iot-hub/) to ingest streaming data from simulated cameras, [Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/?v=16.50) to store photographs, [Azure Stream Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/stream-analytics/) to process real-time data streams, [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions/) to process output from Stream Analytics, Microsoft's [Custom Vision Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/) to analyze photographs for polar pears, [Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/) to build a dashboard for visualizing results, and [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database/) as a data source for Power BI.

## Learning Objectives

In this module, you will:
- Create an Azure Storage account and an IoT hub then use them to write a NodeJS app to connect them to a simulated camera.
- Use Azure Stream Analytics to run queries on live streams to analyze input and an Azure Function to return output.
- Use Cognitive Services to train an image classification model and call the model from an app or service.
- Connect Power BI to an Azure SQL database and visualize data from the database.
