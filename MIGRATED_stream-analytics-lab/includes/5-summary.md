In this hands-on lab, you learned how to:

- Inject streaming data with Azure IoT Hub
- Analyze the data with Azure Stream Analytics
- Use Cognitive Services to predict results
- Use Power BI to visualize the output

In a series of four hands-on exercises, you built a solution that feeds data from a simulated array of cameras into an [Azure IoT hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/iot-hub/), uploads photographs to [Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/?v=16.50), processes the data using [Azure Stream Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/stream-analytics/), analyzes the photographs using the [Custom Vision Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/), and visualizes the output using [Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/). You also got first-hand experience using [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions/) and [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database/). It's a sophisticated solution, and one that has applications in the real world.

Once you're finished using the solution, you should delete all the Azure services you deployed so they no longer charge to your subscription. To delete them, simply go to the Azure Portal and delete the "streaminglab-rg" resource group. That's one of the many benefits of using resource groups: one simple action deletes the resource group and everything inside it. Once deleted, a resource group cannot be recovered, so make sure you're finished with it before deleting it.
