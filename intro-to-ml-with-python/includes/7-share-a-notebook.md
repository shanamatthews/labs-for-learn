One of the value-added features of Azure Notebooks is that it provides a cloud-based hub for sharing notebooks. In this exercise, you will share the notebook you created in previous exercises.

1. Select **File** -> **Close and Halt** to close the notebook.

1. Click **Share**. Notebooks can be shared by links, on social media, and through email. To demonstrate, click **Copy to clipboard** to copy a link to the notebook to the clipboard. Then paste the link into a separate browser window and confirm that the notebook appears there. Finish up by clicking **Close** to close the share dialog.

Another way to share a notebook is to download it as a .ipynb file and send the .ipynb file to whomever you wish to share it with. You can download a notebook by clicking the **Download** button. Downloading .ipynb files is also useful for making local copies of your notebooks. You can even run them in other Jupyter environments if you would like because there is nothing proprietary about Azure Notebooks.
