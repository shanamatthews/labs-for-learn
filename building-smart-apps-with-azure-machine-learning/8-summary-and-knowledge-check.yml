  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: "When training a model, what module do you use to separate your data into training and testing sets?"
    choices:
    - content: "Edit Metadata"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "The edit metadata module will only allow you to edit the metadata associated with the dataset."
    - content: "Split Data"
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: "The 'Split Data' model is used to split the data into training and testing sets."
    - content: "Select Columns in Dataset"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "The select columns module will only return a new dataset of the specified columns."

  - content: "When evaluating your model, what module is used so you don't have to manually compare each value in the test dataset?"
    choices:
    - content: "Compare"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "There is no compare module."
    - content: "Score"

      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: "The evaluate module will evaluate the scores of each row of data in the test set and compares each value for you."

  - content: "How does the Electron client call the machine learning model?"
    choices:
    - content: "Through a REST API."
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: "The web service that was created in Exercise 5 is used to call the model with a new set of data and returns the result."
    - content: "The model is saved locally and called"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "The model isn't saved locally when built with Azure Machine Learning Studio."
    - content: "There is no machine learning model in the Electron client."
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "The Electron client does make a call to the machine learning model that was just created."
