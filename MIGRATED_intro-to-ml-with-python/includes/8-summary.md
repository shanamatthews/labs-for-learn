The [Azure Notebooks Web site](https://notebooks.azure.com/) contains several sample notebooks that you can experiment with and learn from. [Discover Sentiments in Tweets](https://notebooks.azure.com/Microsoft/libraries/samples/html/Discover%20Sentiments%20in%20Tweets.ipynb) performs sentiment analysis on 160,000 tweets, and uses the [word_cloud](https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud) package to generate word clouds from the tweets. [Introduction to Cognitive Toolkit](https://notebooks.azure.com/cntk/libraries/tutorials) is a library of notebooks that demonstrate how to use the [Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/product/cognitive-toolkit/) to build sophisticated machine-learning models. Check out the Azure Notebooks home page for additional sample notebooks, and use them to deepen your understanding of Jupyter and sharpen your data-science skills.
