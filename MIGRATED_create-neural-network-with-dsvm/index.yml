title: Create neural networks with TensorFlow on the Azure Data Science Virtual Machine
summary: Learn how to use TensorFlow to train a deep neural network on the Azure Data Science Virtual Machine.
abstract:  | 
  In this module, you will:
  - Create a Linux Data Science Virtual Machine in Azure
  - Connect to the DSVM via remote desktop
  - Train a TensorFlow model to classify images as ones containing hot dogs and ones NOT containing hot dogs
  - Use the model in a Python app
prerequisites: |
  - An [Xfce](https://xfce.org/) remote-desktop client such as [X2Go](https://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/download:start)
