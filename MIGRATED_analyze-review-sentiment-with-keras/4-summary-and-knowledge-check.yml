  questions:

  - content: "What best describes Keras?"
    choices:
    - content: "It is a deep learning library to build neural networks."
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "Keras isn't a deep learning library itself, but uses deep learning libraries in the backend."
    - content: "It is a library to help clean data."
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "While Keras has some helper functions for data, it is mainly to help build deep learning libraries."
    - content: "It is an API wrapper on top of deep learning libraries such as Tesnorflow and the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit."
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: "Keras uses deep learning libraries in the backend to create models, but allows the code to be much simpler."

  - content: "What does calling `model.summary()` do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Produces a summary of layers for the compiled model."
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: "This function will give a text representation of the different layers of the model."
    - content: "Produces a summary of the training data used in the model."
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "This function doesn't show about the training data."
    - content: "Produces a summary of the predictions made from the model."
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "This function doesn't show about predictions."

  - content: "What method on the model is used to make a prediction on new data?"
    choices:
    - content: "evaluate"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "The evaluate method evaluates the performance of the model."
    - content: "predict"
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: "The predict method will predict on new data."
    - content: "forecast"
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "There is no forecast function on the model."
