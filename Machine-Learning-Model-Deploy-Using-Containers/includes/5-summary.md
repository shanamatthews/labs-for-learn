# Summary

At the outset, it seemed a daunting task: train a machine-learning model to analyze text for sentiment, operationalize the model in a Docker container, run the container in Azure, and expose a REST API for invoking the model. You went one step further and built a cross-platform app for demonstrating the solution. It wasn't as difficult as it first seemed, thanks to Scikit-learn, Flask, Docker, and the Docker support in Azure.

You could go even further. You could build an app that monitors Twitter for tweets about your company, quantify the sentiment of each tweet, and fire a notification to the communications department if the running average falls below a certain threshold â€” for example, if the average sentiment expressed in the last 10 tweets is less than 0.4. You've already done the hard part. The rest is simply a variation on what you've already learned.
